# This is a Project I did while studying Data Analysis

# Analysis of Nobel Prize Winners (1901-2023)
This Jupyter Notebook explores a dataset of all Nobel Prize winners from 1901 to 2023. The analysis delves into the demographics of the laureates, trends over time, and identifies notable prize winners. The dataset is sourced from the Nobel Prize API.

# The project uses pandas and numpy to analyze the data and answer the following questions:

1. What are the most common demographics of Nobel laureates? Identifies the gender and birth country most frequently represented among the winners.

2. What was the decade of U.S. dominance? Calculates the proportion of U.S.-born winners for each decade to find the decade with the highest concentration of American laureates.

3. In which category and decade have women had the most success? Determines the proportion of female winners per category for each decade to pinpoint the decade and field with the highest representation of female laureates.

4. Who was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize? Filters the dataset to find the name and prize category of the first-ever female winner.

5. Who are the repeat prize winners? Generates a list of all individuals and organizations that have been awarded the Nobel Prize more than once.
